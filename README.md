# Chatbot Project

## Description

This project is a chatbot application that allows users to interact with a conversational agent. The chatbot can respond to predefined queries, fetch jokes from an external API, and provide information about cities using another external API. It leverages natural language processing through Dialogflow to understand and process user inputs, offering a seamless and engaging user experience.

## Features

- Predefined responses for common queries like "hi" and "how are you."
- Integration with an external Jokes API to fetch and display random jokes.
- Integration with an external City Information API to retrieve and present details about cities.
- Natural language processing capabilities powered by Dialogflow.
- User-friendly web interface built with React.ts.
- Helpful prompts for first-time users to guide them on how to interact with the chatbot.
